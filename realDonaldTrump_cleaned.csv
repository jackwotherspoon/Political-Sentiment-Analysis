“omb official: ukraine aid held up because other countries weren't giving” 

the d.c. wolves and fake news media are reading far too much into people being forced by courts to testify before congress. i am fighting for future presidents and the office of the president. other than that, i would actually like people to testify. don mcgahn’s respected....
when the military rips down an old &amp; badly broken border wall in an important location, &amp; replaces it with a brand new 30 ft. high steel &amp; concrete wall, nancy pelosi says we are not building a wall. wrong, and it is going up fast. brandon judd just gave us great marks! 
i will always protect our great warfighters. i’ve got your backs!
great job heather! 
“poll shows dems losing interest in impeachment inquiry all across the board. these polls are actually devastating to the democrats. but the writing was on the wall. he’s done so many great things. he’s devastated isis &amp; killed albaghdadi, building wall.” jason meister 

“democrats committed to impeaching trump for no reason.” will backfire into big 2020 victory for republicans! 
“dow, nasdaq, s&amp;p 500 close at record highs” 

another new stock market record. enjoy!
“the democrats are getting hit and slammed on impeachment. it is getting less and less popular by the day.”  
support for impeachment is dropping like a rock, down into the 20’s in some polls. dems should now get down to work and finally approve usmca, and much more!
“president trump is facing a process which is unprecedented for its unfairness.” sam dewey
i was not pleased with the way that navy seal eddie gallagher’s trial was handled by the navy. he was treated very badly but, despite this, was completely exonerated on all major charges. i then restored eddie’s rank. likewise, large cost overruns from past administration’s.....
democrats going back to their districts for thanksgiving are getting absolutely hammered by their constituents over the phony impeachment scam. republicans will have a great 2020 election!
“the whole russia thing was a hoax, and the ukraine thing is a hoax, and the democrats are a joke. this is a disaster for them!”   the do nothing democrats are hurting our country, and they don’t care!
the impeachment scam is driving republican poll numbers up, up, up! thank you shifty.
this is a great and well reseached book on justice k. the ruth marcus book is a badly written &amp; reseached disaster. so many incorrect facts. fake news, just like the  
witch hunt! 
but i did nothing wrong. read the transcripts (2)! 
100% correct! 
agnes, your great boy ronald is looking down, very proud of you! 
exclusive: elise stefanik reflects on her two-week whirlwind 
the unspoken truth: what impeachment exposed about trump and 2020 
this is the real story behind the do nothing democrats! 
too bad we didn’t have the g-7 here. i offered to pick up the entire cost, would have saved at least $35,000,000 for the usa. best location. very stupid people thought i would gain. wrong! looking at camp david. will announce soon. 
polls have now turned very strongly against impeachment, especially in swing states. 75% to 25%. thank you!
nancy pelosi, adam schiff, aoc and the rest of the democrats are not getting important legislation done, hence, the do nothing democrats. usmca, national defense authorization act, gun safety, prescription drug prices, &amp; infrastructure are dead in the water because of the dems!
navy seal eddie gallagher will be on  this morning at 7:30 a.m. have no fear, all will end well for everyone!
pushed hard to have apple build in usa! 



95% approval rate in the republican party, a record! thank you!
thank you kevin for the nice words! 
new york post editorial. “worse than pointless. all those hours of televised testimony plainly failed on their announced goal: to change american’s minds. part of the problem is that democrats already leaked the best evidence they had. more important, not one witness offered.....
daniel cameron, who just won the a.g. race in the great commonwealth of kentucky, is a young and very talented political star. you will be hearing much from cameron in the years to come!
“the democrats dirty tricks have started this whole thing. the whistleblower, the guy who took his case to schiff’s staff first, is what really blows the lid off this entire saga. he worked for biden on ukraine policy when biden was vp. he worked for deep state henchman john
joe concha, the hill: “in emerson college poll, impeachment among independents, 49% oppose, 34% support. you see why pelosi is reluctant to go in with this. dems have to go home and explain why they haven’t done something on opioid crisis, drug prices, usmca, the border, etc.
adam schiff will be compelled to testify should the democrats decide, despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate (perfect), to go forward with the impeachment hoax. polls have now turned very strongly against impeachment!
“the support for impeachment is not there. i think the democrats will have to come up with a new game plan.”  

. and i will soon release a plan to let florida and other states import prescription drugs that are much cheaper than what we have now! hard-working americans don’t deserve to pay such high prices for the drugs they need. we are fighting daily to make sure this happens...
thank you to  mitch mcconnell and  kevin mccarthy for their great leadership! there has never been so much unity and spirit in the republican party, as there is right now!
i will be interviewed on  this morning at 8:00 a.m. i know that there’s not much to talk about, but we will try to keep the conversation going. enjoy!   
“former fbi employee accused of altering fisa documents.” hello, here we go! 

thank you  and  great job! 

mark levin on impeachment hysteria! 
"schiff's charade"  
schiff's "fact" witnesses! 
iran has become so unstable that the regime has shut down their entire internet system so that the great iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country....
ken starr, former independent counsel: “does this reach the level of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors? my assessment of the evidence so far, no where close. the evidence is conflicting &amp; ambiguous. ambassador sondland’s testimony stated that....
i have been watching people making phone calls my entire life. my hearing is, and has been, great. never have i been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. i’ve even tried, but to no avail. try it live!
read the two transcripts of ukrainian calls!
the navy will not be taking away warfighter and navy seal eddie gallagher’s trident pin. this case was handled very badly from the beginning. get back to business!
“the new house resolution gives adam schiff (the most dishonest man in politics) the power unilaterally to release edited transcripts. rule 10 gives chairman schiff absolutely no jurisdiction. subpoenas issued as part of dems’ impeachment inquiry are illegal.” sam dewey 
corrupt politician adam schiff’s lies are growing by the day. keep fighting tough, republicans, you are dealing with human scum who have taken due process and all of the republican party’s rights away from us during the most unfair hearings in american history......
i never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, impeachment! the calls (transcripts) were perfect, there was nothing said that was wrong. no pressure on ukraine. great corruption &amp; dishonesty by schiff on the other side!
“freed taliban hostages arrive in germany.”      we got them back!
bob mueller, after spending two years and 45 million dollars, went over all of my financials, &amp; my taxes, and found nothing. now the witch hunt continues with local new york democrat prosecutors going over every financial deal i have ever done. this has never happened to a.....
the republican party, and me, had a great day yesterday with respect to the phony impeachment hoax, &amp; yet, when i got home to the white house &amp; checked out the news coverage on much of television, you would have no idea they were reporting on the same event. fake &amp; corrupt news!
during my visit yesterday to austin, texas, for the startup of the new mac pro, &amp; the discussion of a new one $billion campus, also in texas, i asked tim cook to see if he could get apple involved in building 5g in the u.s. they have it all - money, technology, vision &amp; cook!l
why do  &amp;  waste airtime on democrat rep. eric swalwell, who recently left the presidential primaries having attained a grand number of zero in the polls. i don’t even know how that is possible. fox should stay with the people that got them there, not losers!

poll: trump leads top 2020 democrats in wisconsin 
“all four of gordon sondland’s lawyers are democrat donors.”   despite this, big win today for republicans!
watch    big news! 

if this were a prizefight, they’d stop it!
today i opened a major apple manufacturing plant in texas that will bring high paying jobs back to america. today nancy pelosi closed congress because she doesn’t care about american workers!
i want nothing! 
impeachment witch hunt is now over! ambassador sondland asks u.s. president (me): “what do you want from ukraine? i keep hearing all these different ideas &amp; theories. what do you want? it was a very abrupt conversation. he was not in a good mood. he (the president) just said,”...
we join families of kevin king &amp; tim weeks in celebrating their release from taliban captivity. thanks to president ghani for his courageous support. let’s hope this leads to more good things on the peace front like a ceasefire that will help end this long war. proud of my team!

nancy pelosi will go down as the least productive speaker of the house in history. she is dominated by aoc plus 3 and the radical left. mexico and canada, after waiting for 6 months to be approved, are ready to flee - and who can blame them? too bad!
“white house confidence grows as hearings wear on.”   this is just an attempted takedown of the republican party by the do nothing democrats. it will never work. 2020
the three year hoax continues! 
true. great job  
read the transcripts! 
thank you tennessee! 
congressman van drew (d-nj): we’ve spent millions of dollars, in my opinion, tons of money, tons of time, tons of hurt, fracturing the nation apart. i haven’t seen this to be a good thing.”
a great day for republicans, a great day for our country!
i agree, but in the end we will win and save our country from certain destruction! 


nasdaq up 27% this year alone!
nancy pelosi just stated that “it is dangerous to let the voters decide trump’s fate.”   in other words, she thinks i’m going to win and doesn’t want to take a chance on letting the voters decide. like al green, she wants to change our voting system. wow, she’s crazy!
the do nothing democrats have disgraced our great country! 
at my meeting with jay powell this morning, i protested fact that our fed rate is set too high relative to the interest rates of other competitor countries. in fact, our rates should be lower than all others (we are the u.s.). too strong a dollar hurting manufacturers &amp; growth!
mark levin speaking one week after i took office. this was always a planned coup and the radical left democrats will suffer at the polls in 2020! 
great news! maga kag 
thank you! maga kag 

“congressman van drew (d-nj) slams democrats for ‘fracturing the nation’ with impeachment probe. ‘we already know how it’s going to end.” 
just finished a very good &amp; cordial meeting at the white house with jay powell of the federal reserve. everything was discussed including interest rates, negative interest, low inflation, easing, dollar strength &amp; its effect on manufacturing, trade with china, e.u. &amp; others, etc.
our crazy, do nothing (where’s usmca, infrastructure, lower drug pricing &amp; much more?) speaker of the house, nervous nancy pelosi, who is petrified by her radical left knowing she will soon be gone (they &amp; fake news media are her boss), suggested on sunday’s deface the nation....
never has the republican party been so united as it is now. 95% a.r. this is a great fraud being played out against the american people by the fake news media &amp; their partner, the do nothing democrats. the rules are rigged by pelosi &amp; schiff, but we are winning, and we will win!

“all they do is bring up witnesses who didn’t witness anything.”    nothing matters except the two transcripts of the presidential calls, and the statement of no pressure put out by ukraine!
“the impeachment started before he even became president.”   


where is the fake whistleblower?

republicans &amp; others must remember, the ukrainian president and foreign minister both said that there was no pressure placed on them whatsoever. also, they didn’t even know the money wasn’t paid, and got the money with no conditions. but why isn’t germany, france (europe) paying?
the crazed, do nothing democrats are turning impeachment into a routine partisan weapon. that is very bad for our country, and not what the founders had in mind!!!!
tell jennifer williams, whoever that is, to read both transcripts of the presidential calls, &amp; see the just released ststement from ukraine. then she should meet with the other never trumpers, who i don’t know &amp; mostly never even heard of, &amp; work out a better presidential attack!

paul krugman of  has been wrong about me from the very beginning. anyone who has followed his “words of wisdom” has lost a great deal of money. paul, just concede the game, say i was right, and lets start a brand new game! 
schiff is a corrupt politician! 
. blew the nasty &amp; obnoxious chris wallace (will never be his father, mike!) away on chris’s lowest rated (unless i’m on) morning show. this kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the  past. great job steve!
thanks eric! 



paul krugman has called me wrong from day one. people at the failing new york times are very angry at him for having “missed” by soooo much. paul, match over! 




i agree katrina, pam bondi is a great woman! 
the do nothing dems are now doing even less - and soooo much work to be done!
joe ricketts, one of our country’s most successful businessmen, including being the owner of the chicago cubs, has just written a great new book, the harder you work, the luckier you get. so true! much can be learned from joe. go get the book!
a big difference! 
our great farmers will recieve another major round of “cash,” compliments of china tariffs, prior to thanksgiving. the smaller farms and farmers will be big beneficiaries. in the meantime, and as you may have noticed, china is starting to buy big again. japan deal done. enjoy!
. has a great show going on right now, 10:00 a.m. fantastic guests talk about the fake impeachment!  
mr. chairman, joe biden may be sleepy and very slow, but he is not a “rabid dog.” he is actually somewhat better than that, but i am the only one who can get you where you have to be. you should act quickly, get the deal done. see you soon! 
dowd never understood the pulse of the republican party, present or past. he’s just a 3rd rate hit job for fake news  
a new republican star is born. great going  
thank you pete. our great warfighters must be allowed to fight. i would not have done this for sgt. bergdahl or chelsea manning! 
visited a great family of a young man under major surgery at the amazing walter reed medical center. those are truly some of the best doctors anywhere in the world. also began phase one of my yearly physical. everything very good (great!). will complete next year.



true! 
congratulations kimberley. great book!
